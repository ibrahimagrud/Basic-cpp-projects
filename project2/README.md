Code Structure and Functions

##Prerequisites

To understand this code, itâ€™s helpful to be familiar with:

    Logical Operators: Used in leap year checking and determining the number of days in a month.
    How Functions Work: Each task is handled by individual functions for modularity.
    Recursive Functions: Some logical components may require knowledge of recursion, especially in DayOfWeekOrder.



The code includes the following core functions:

    readYear(): Reads the year input from the user.
    isLeapYear(): Checks if the entered year is a leap year.
    readMounth(): Reads the month input from the user.
    getMonth(): Returns the name of the month based on its numeric value.
    DayOfWeekOrder(): Calculates the day of the week for a given date.
    numberDaysInMounth(): Returns the number of days in the month based on the provided month and year.
    PrintMonthCalendar(): Formats and prints the calendar for the specified month and year.
